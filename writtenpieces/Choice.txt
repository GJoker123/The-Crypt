<p><strong>Choice </strong></p>
<br>
<p>Relaxing at home with my wonderful girlfriend laying beside me, drinking orange juice and watching TV, I managed to achieve a lot in my life and now I&rsquo;m enjoying all the benefits I earned. Well, I say that but honestly... It is getting kind of boring. It feels like... Like I&rsquo;m struck in a bubble; comfortable inside but forced to experience that comfortable feeling forever, eventually getting sick and tired of it. Unable to escape, slowly suffocating inside that dense space.</p>
<p>Even Hs${i$epp$hiwivzi$e$glsmgiC 4 now I can sense my girlfriend is trying to discuss something probably important to her, (her job maybe?) but it filtered through as background noise, merged with the annoying sounds coming from the 18 &ndash; inch TV blasting some MTV show depicting three curvy, middle-aged women around a coffee stained table with bemused expressions on their faces. Even now, as her tone increases (probably to catch my attention) and a stinging sensation begins on my left arm, I can only remain motionless as the smell of orange juice pour into my nose, reminding me of the oranges I used to collect as a child and show off to a local girl near my home, sharing and eating together, joking and teasing each other till we go blue in the face. Somehow, that memory manages to sneak into my consciousness, manifesting as air to supply relief inside my bubble, making it bearable.</p>
<p>Even now, as the white noise increases and the sensation deepens (It hurts) I&rsquo;m captivated by the memories formed in my mind, released after being buried deep in my sub-consciousness for so long. Of me and her growing up. Laughing. Crying. Holding. Each memory becoming a tiny amount of refreshing air easing the pain, expanding the space bit by bit.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t last.</p>
<p>As my girlfriend jumps up, screaming and pointing an accusatory finger at the TV screen, her face a shade of red, her fierce eyes penetrating into me (not this again, please), a single memory floats into my bubble. It displays a moving image of a field covered in yellow wheat at night - a background of golden stars illuminating the clear sky. It also shows me and her, the local girl, standing in the field with only our jackets as a source of warmth. She opens her mouth and says something. Suddenly the memory pops and forms a hole, sucking in all the air, taking in all the tears and laughter.</p>
<p>Taking her from me.</p>
<p>The bubble closes in on me, back in the space of eternity; my happiness turns to pain as I begin to suffocate in the claustrophobic space. As I desperately tried to regain those specks of happiness back, a sharp pain flares on the left of my face. I snap back to reality where I see my girlfriend with her hand raised, ready to strike me again (not again, please). Instead, she lowers her hand and runs out of the living room, screaming obscurities as she runs. Left on my own, I place my head in my hands and begin to cry. Unleashing a river of tears.</p>
