<p><strong>What is sleep? </strong></p>
<br>
<p>Sleep can be interpreted in many ways and researched countless of times and yet, we truly don&rsquo;t understand the deeper meaning to this simple act. Instead, most take this ability as it is and are grateful for the benefits and rewards it grants; the feeling of renewal, the elimination of stress and the strength to face the obstacles of the ever-spiralling labyrinth known as life. We as a species relies on the idea of sleep, on the idea of rest, being able to recuperate and share the pains and tribulations of today through an interchangeable space designed by your subconscious. From this space things are given life, forms take shape and ideas are sprung from the deepest well of the human psyche. These peculiar phenomenons are known as dreams. Wonders that span from an infinite number of possibilities and have existed since the beginning of our sentience. Dreams have been known to inspire, uplift and share specks of wisdom that has contributed to civilizations and break-throughs and ultimately, reveal the parts of us that we rarely encounter and interact with.</p>
<p>Therefore, is sleep a doorway to Truth and Possibilities?</p>
<p>However, just as sleep can bring joy and wisdom in the form of dreams, it can also bring despair and fear in the form of nightmares. Nightmares that &ndash; while within the world of make-believe &ndash; are born from the darkness and evils of life. Monsters that roam through the hearts and minds of people, continuously infecting the space with negativity and toxins that inflict fear and panic. These nightmares are similar to dreams, as they also are brought forth from the abyss of the human psyche. Sometimes, these nightmares are given such energy that they manifest in the physical world, leaving the person so weak that they are left paralysed as their nightmare appears over them as a being composed of shadows that obscures sight. It is unknown how and why these types of occurrences happen and most importantly, the process in which these nightmares are able to materialise whilst you&rsquo;re in a vulnerable state.</p>
<p>Therefore, is sleep a portal to dimensions beyond our Knowledge?</p>
<p>Despite being able to perform great feats and performances within our dreams and nightmares, in reality, the majority of us barely move. Whilst this can be explained scientifically with certain chemicals within us inhibiting specialised cells that control movement, the idea of the soul also comes into play. The soul, an incorporeal essence of a living being, isn&rsquo;t bound to the same laws as the physical body is. Within the space of creation, the soul is free to do whatsoever, and can shape itself into anything. Through this realisation we can also say that once we enter into the fictional world, we ourselves can be or do anything we so desire as only our souls are invited, whereas our physical bodies lay dormant in the actual world. Taking this to further heights, once we master our souls (in other terms &ndash; ourselves) we can literally shape the world within our sleep to our liking and proceed to perform everything and anything within it, until the sensation of waking approaches, at which point we begin to return to our dormant bodies.</p>

<p>Therefore, is sleep a pathway between our Physical and Spiritual bodies?</p>
<p>Which comes to my final point. What happens to those who sleep forever? Once the brain shut down, the person is said to be dead and removed from the land of the living. At that point, what does the person feel, smell, touch, hear and see? Those who experiences the end of their lives enter into a sleep they do not wake up from, signifying the detachment between their soul and their body and their cease of communication with the real world, forever lost to the vast sea of possibilities and nothingness. As such, the description of the world after death is sealed within the mouths of the decreased. Forever and always withholding their answers from the question:</p>
