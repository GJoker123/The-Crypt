<p><strong>Journey </strong></p>
<br>
<p>Fade to darkness. Obscured by the shadows that lie in the corners of your failing mind. Watching your slow descent into the pool of madness, dotted with specks of golden sadness.</p>
<p>Ruined dreams bring reunited cries of sorrow and despair. Mixed in the ever &ndash; growing primordial soup of fury, wrath, agony.</p>
<p>Shouts from those perished, mingled with the groans and moans of the living produces a cacophony of hate and misery &ndash; a representation of the tragedies inflicted on the dead and the living.</p>
<p>Memories float around fleetingly, showing past lives that have been enriched by beauty and wealth, successful in strength and prosperity, leaders of great armies and of voluptuous women. They all have one thing in common &ndash; only death awaits them in the end.</p>
<p>A cold touch, the soul disappears, sent to a place inhabited by nothing but the echoes of life: the Laughter, the Tears, the Anger, the Hatred, the Chaos, the Beauty and finally: Retribution.</p>
<p>The mind eye awakens to a higher plane of reality. Revealed, the gift of enlightenment becomes entitled and granted. All that is lost has become clear. All that is clear has become lost. The curse of entitlement has enlightened the senses. The eye looks towards the abyss. It has discovered its purpose. It has rejected its purpose.</p>
<p>Naked, the sin of life is revealed: a wasteland scarred from the touch of hate, poisoned by the toxins excreted from the jaws of promiscuity. Taking in the bitter water, Life becomes renew, flourishes with the taste and spreads its seeds of love. The seeds plant in the bitter water and grow twisted, tortured by their own creation &ndash; the sin of life is revealed.</p>
<p>The dismembered hand touches the petals and grabs them, the skin flayed and the nerves black as the darkness. The thick blood drips onto the petals causing the plants to wilt, filled with the taste of hope.</p>
<p>The spiral into Madness is over, but the journey to Peace begins.</p>
