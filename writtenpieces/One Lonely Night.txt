<p><strong>One Lonely Night </strong></p>
<br>
<p>The blaring of police sirens reached the man&rsquo;s ears as he closed the door and walked to the living room. Another murder or robbery occurring in the big city he believed as he sat down on the couch and observe the room. Nothing changed, the lamp was left on before he left, producing a golden glow that brightened the room, the empty packets of crisps mingled with the dirty boxes of pizzas on the carpet, staining the dusty books with their expired juices and the TV screen remained black. His world was left untouched, devoid of life and attention, welcoming him into comfort from the outside world.</p>
<p>He could hear the irregular bouts of laughter and shouts coming from upstairs, probably the neighbour watching the football match between Barcelona and Arsenal, a pairing that has taken weeks of preparing. The man didn&rsquo;t care much for the match, only had one thing on his mind &ndash; the Surge; the only source of happiness and excitement the man would ever need. It resided inside his drawer, in a special compartment that only he knew of. He needed it quickly, it was the month of December and memories of his family were invading his mind. He knew after the memories of the warmth and love, the cold thoughts of despair would come. Only the Surge could prevent this.</p>
<p>He opened the drawer and saw it. The syringe. He must have forgotten to hide it in the secret compartment after his last session. Doesn&rsquo;t matter, he snatched the syringe and checked for the Surge. Yes! There was some left. He ripped off his tie and tightened it around his forearm, desperate to remove the feelings and thoughts rising in him; the self-loathing, the misery, the self-pity. The Surge would make them disappear, keep them at bay. The Surge was the key to his cage of loneliness and despair. Soon the darkness would disappear and there would only be light.</p>
<p>There wasn&rsquo;t any laughter coming from upstairs anymore, just shouting. The man could pick out a feminine voice, the pitch increasing to match with the gruff, deep voice in a battle for dominance. Did something happen? Does it matter? The man was relieved, untroubled, his memories blurred and his negative thoughts evaporated. Family? What family? There was only him, his world and the Surge flowing through his veins. Nothing else matters, he wasn&rsquo;t alone; he was with his friends; his reliable lamp, his trusty couch and his shy television. Christmas would pass by and he would celebrate, having a massive dinner party with all his friends. He was fine, as long as he had the Surge, the sweet, delicious, numbing Surge. Everything would be okay.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>That single word popped into his mind, a spear that penetrated his bubble of blissful illusion. The effects of the Surge must be fading he decided, realising he needed more.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>The word continued to appear in his mind, like a wasp determined to make its presence known, he needed the syringe, where was it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>There on the side of the couch he found the tool, he quickly grabbed it and check for Surge, already preparing his veins for another dose, to slow his hyperactive mind and fall back into the pool of oblivion.</p>
<p>No. There was no Surge in the syringe. It was empty; like him as the effects of the Surge faded away. The screams and thumps coming from the above flat reflected the fragile state of his mind &ndash; full of anger. Angry at the world for the lack of help and kindness, he screams. A long, piercing scream that releases the loathing and hatred he kept in for so long. A scream that invites the silence.</p>
<p>Christmas would pass by, the sirens of the city would blare, he would earn enough money to buy the Surge again, but in his heart, he knew the loneliness would come. It always does, and he knew that no amount of Surge would prevent that. Nevertheless, he needed the Surge, as it was the only thing that spared him the pain.</p>
