<p><strong>A Particular Talk </strong></p>
<br>
<p>Hello. You probably won&rsquo;t understand this but don&rsquo;t worry. Just know that I know you. I heard you. I noticed you. Notice the brand on the upper of your arm, striking isn&rsquo;t it? I can sense the coldness of fear in you. I can taste the tantalising fear enveloping your warm blood, producing that perfect duality of life and death.</p>
<p>Who are you to me? Who am I to you? This is a question that has no relevance at this moment. For now, understand that I have appeared to answer you and your insignificant problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I notice you keep staring at the brand, yes; the chiselled representation of the symbol is truly beautiful. Marvel at how the dove is entwined with the crow in a never &ndash; ending spiral of wind and fire. Look closely at the crow&lsquo;s eyes and how realistic there are &ndash; able to project the fiercest gaze that those unprepared can succumbed to. Be silent, hear the distant sounds of wing flapping, each flap booming with elegance and yet, also with the faint warning of power. Can you understand what the symbol represents? Life and Death, the joys of being one with harmony and life, but also the despair of descending into death and ultimately nothingness. Ah, the smell of fear once again, so overwhelming, so pungent.</p>
<p>Sorry, I&rsquo;m going off topic aren&rsquo;t I? Back to your problems shall we? Ah, the usual. Always about the wife that becomes distant, the debts that plagued your mind, coupled with that never-ending doubt of your children. Sorry, I meant THE children. Oh dear, someone is certainly in turmoil over their pathetic situation, no wonder you called out to me. No, obviously you didn&rsquo;t speak or mutter my name, but instead your sub &ndash; consciousness reached out. Admit it, you desperately want to leave this dying spark you call a life and disappear off to greater pastures &ndash; deep down inside of you, there is that hoarse cry of help that urgently begs for a change, for a difference, for another chance.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;I can give you this. </strong></p>
<p>However, like all things in life, there comes a price. In exchange for the new life, you must provide me with a sacrifice. An eye for an eye as He says, and as such, a person&rsquo;s life for yours, but, before you decide to make this trade understand this &ndash; the person&rsquo;s life traded must be related to through a special bond. The cold wife or the blue - eyed children, this decision can only be made by you...</p>
<p>I see you have made your choice. Understandable to why you have picked this, regarding the circumstances. Very well, I shall abide by this trade and complete the exchange &ndash; your life over theirs; I hope you are satisfied with your new life.</p>
<p>Oh, I nearly forgot. While you have been given new life, understand that the life given is not always necessarily a better one. Life is full of hardship and obstacles and it depends on you being able to crawl and struggle on your own to survive and thrive. With that being said, enjoy trying to crawl out of this coffin. Now, if you truly want it, you can finally have another chance at life.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t waste it.</strong></p>
<p>Goodbye.</p>
